To help you properly, I'll provide examples in a few popular programming languages. Please choose one that best matches your preferences.\n\nHere's the code in Python:\n\n```python\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\nprint(c)\n```\n\nIn JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet c = a + b;\nconsole.log(c);\n```\n\nIn Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int a = 1;\n        int b = 2;\n        int c = a + b;\n        System.out.println(c);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn Ruby:\n\n```ruby\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\nputs c\n```\n\nAll of these code snippets perform the addition of `a` and `b` and store the result in variable `c`. The value of `c` will be `3` (1 + 2) in all cases."
