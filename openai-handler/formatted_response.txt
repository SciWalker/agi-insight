Your code appears to have a simple mathematical expression `a+b=c`, which implies that you want to add two numbers together and store the result in a variable. If you are writing the code using a specific programming language, here are some examples of how you could accomplish this:

In Python:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print(c)
```

In JavaScript:

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = a + b;
console.log(c);
```

In Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        int c = a + b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```

In Ruby:

```ruby
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
puts c
```

All of these code snippets perform the addition of `a` and `b` and store the result in variable `c`. The value of `c` will be `3` (1 + 2) in all cases.
